Okay, so I need to figure out what's going to be on the CIS 481 exam based on the context provided.
Let me start by reading through all the given information carefully.
First, I see a reference from ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology about distinguishing LLM-generated code from human-written code using contrastive learning.
There are tables mentioning different encoders like CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and UniXcoder with metrics such as F1-score and AUC.
This suggests that topics related to machine learning models applied to code analysis might be on the exam.
Next, there's a section about formulas for finding the history of a program.
The formula (m+n)!/(m!·n!) is mentioned, along with an extension when dealing with n processes each having m atomic actions: (n⋅m)!/(m!^n).
This indicates that combinatorics and concurrency concepts are important areas.
Then, there's a part about properties of programs, specifically safety and liveness.
Safety properties ensure that "something bad" never happens, with examples like mutual exclusion and memory safety.
Liveness properties, while mentioned, don't have specific examples here.
Understanding these fundamental concepts in program correctness is likely crucial for the exam.
Additionally, there are references to post-quantum cryptography, including drafts from NIST about standardization of quantum-resistant algorithms.
This implies that the course covers current trends and future directions in cryptography, possibly focusing on transition from classical to post-quantum methods.
I also notice some broken links and references, but they seem more like citations rather than exam content.
Putting this all together, the CIS 481 exam probably tests knowledge in software engineering with a focus on machine learning applications in code analysis, concurrency and combinatorics, program properties (safety and liveness), and modern cryptography including post-quantum methods.
Students should be prepared to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, especially in areas where software engineering intersects with AI and security.

The CIS 481 exam will cover topics such as machine learning models for code analysis, combinatorics in concurrency, program properties like safety and liveness, and post-quantum cryptography.
Emphasis is on applying theoretical concepts to practical problems at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and security.
